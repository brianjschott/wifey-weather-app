# Wifey Weather
## A weather app written for my wife

I wrote this app as a sample of work in Sinatra, object-oriented programming, as well as to give my wife a more-reliable and convenient way to check the weather. Many apps pull out-of-data information; my app makes calls to the NWS servers to ensure the most current forecast is obtained.
